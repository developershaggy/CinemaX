integrated with the TMDB API, to provide a comprehensive platform for exploring movies
and TV shows. The purpose of the website is to allow users to discover and access
information about various movies and TV shows, including their popularity ratings, trending
status, and the ability to search for specific titles.

The methodology involved the use of ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user

providing an intuitive and efficient platform for discovering, accessing, and exploring a wide
range of content. The combination of ReactJS, Vite, and the TMDB API offers a seamless
and enjoyable user experience, facilitating efficient navigation and discovery of movies and
TV shows based on popularity, trending status, and user preferences.
